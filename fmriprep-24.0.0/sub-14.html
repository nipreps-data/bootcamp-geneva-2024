<dt>Functional data preprocessing</dt>
<dd>
<p>For each of the 2 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and
sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference
volume was generated, using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>,
for use in head motion correction. Head-motion parameters with respect
to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding
rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any
spatiotemporal filtering using <code>mcflirt</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">(FSL 6.0.7.12, Jenkinson et al.
2002)</span>. The estimated <em>fieldmap</em> was then aligned with
rigid-registration to the target EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference
run. The field coefficients were mapped on to the reference EPI using
the transform. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w
reference using <code>bbregister</code> (FreeSurfer) which implements
boundary-based registration <span class="citation"
data-cites="bbr">(Greve and Fischl 2009)</span>. Co-registration was
configured with six degrees of freedom. The aligned T2w image was used
for initial co-registration.Several confounding time-series were
calculated based on the <em>preprocessed BOLD</em>: framewise
displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD was
computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of
relative motions, <span class="citation"
data-cites="power_fd_dvars">Power et al. (2014)</span>) and Jenkinson
(relative root mean square displacement between affines, <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">Jenkinson et al. (2002)</span>).
FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their
implementations in <em>Nipype</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="power_fd_dvars">(following the definitions by Power et al.
2014)</span>. The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the
WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological
regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction
<span class="citation" data-cites="compcor">(<em>CompCor</em>, Behzadi
et al. 2007)</span>. Principal components are estimated after high-pass
filtering the <em>preprocessed BOLD</em> time-series (using a discrete
cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two <em>CompCor</em> variants:
temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are
then calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask.
For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM)
are generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that
of Behzadi et al. in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on
BOLD space, a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM
is subtracted from the aCompCor masks. This mask is obtained by dilating
a GM mask extracted from the FreeSurfer’s <em>aseg</em> segmentation,
and it ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a
minimal fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD
space and binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original
implementation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM
and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the <em>k</em> components
with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained
components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance
across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining
components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates
calculated in the correction step were also placed within the
corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head
motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of
temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each <span class="citation"
data-cites="confounds_satterthwaite_2013">(Satterthwaite et al.
2013)</span>. Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5
standardized DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. Additional
nuisance timeseries are calculated by means of principal components
analysis of the signal found within a thin band (<em>crown</em>) of
voxels around the edge of the brain, as proposed by <span
class="citation" data-cites="patriat_improved_2017">(Patriat, Reynolds,
and Birn 2017)</span>. All resamplings can be performed with <em>a
single interpolation step</em> by composing all the pertinent
transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility
distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical
and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed
using <code>nitransforms</code>, configured with cubic B-spline
interpolation.</p>

Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing
performed using *fMRIPrep* 24.1.0.dev28+gfe7c9ff8.d20240822
(@fmriprep1; @fmriprep2; RRID:SCR_016216),
which is based on *Nipype* 1.8.6
(@nipype1; @nipype2; RRID:SCR_002502).



Preprocessing of B<sub>0</sub> inhomogeneity mappings

: A total of 1 fieldmaps were found available within the input
BIDS structure for this particular subject.
A *B<sub>0</sub>* nonuniformity map (or *fieldmap*) was estimated from the
phase-drift map(s) measure with two consecutive GRE (gradient-recalled echo)
acquisitions.
The corresponding phase-map(s) were phase-unwrapped with `prelude` (FSL 6.0.7.12).

Anatomical data preprocessing

: A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input
BIDS dataset. The T1w image was corrected for intensity
non-uniformity (INU) with `N4BiasFieldCorrection` [@n4], distributed with ANTs 2.5.1
[@ants, RRID:SCR_004757], and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a *Nipype* implementation of
the `antsBrainExtraction.sh` workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs
as target template.
Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on
the brain-extracted T1w using `fast` [FSL 6.0.7.12, RRID:SCR_002823, @fsl_fast].
Brain surfaces were reconstructed using `recon-all` [FreeSurfer 7.3.2,
RRID:SCR_001847, @fs_reconall], and the brain mask estimated
previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile
ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical
gray-matter of Mindboggle [RRID:SCR_002438, @mindboggle].
A T2-weighted image was used to improve pial surface refinement.
Brain surfaces were reconstructed using `recon-all` [FreeSurfer 7.3.2,
RRID:SCR_001847, @fs_reconall], and the brain mask estimated
previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile
ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical
gray-matter of Mindboggle [RRID:SCR_002438, @mindboggle].
Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through
nonlinear registration with `antsRegistration` (ANTs 2.5.1),
using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template.
The following template was were selected for spatial normalization
and accessed with *TemplateFlow* [24.2.0, @templateflow]:
*ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c* [@mni152nlin2009casym, RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym].

Functional data preprocessing

: For each of the 2 BOLD runs found per subject (across all
tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed.
First, a reference volume was generated,
using a custom methodology of *fMRIPrep*, for use in head motion correction.
Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference
(transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation
parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using
`mcflirt` [FSL 6.0.7.12, @mcflirt].
The estimated *fieldmap* was then aligned with rigid-registration to the target
EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference run.
The field coefficients were mapped on to the reference EPI using the transform.
The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using
`bbregister` (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration [@bbr].
Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom.
 The aligned T2w image was used for initial co-registration.Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
*preprocessed BOLD*: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and
three region-wise global signals.
FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of
relative motions, @power_fd_dvars) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square
displacement between affines, @mcflirt).
FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their
implementations in *Nipype* [following the definitions by @power_fd_dvars].
The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and
the whole-brain masks.
Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to
allow for component-based noise correction [*CompCor*, @compcor].
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the
*preprocessed BOLD* time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with
128s cut-off) for the two *CompCor* variants: temporal (tCompCor)
and anatomical (aCompCor).
tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable
voxels within the brain mask.
For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM)
are generated in anatomical space.
The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead
of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, a mask of pixels that
likely contain a volume fraction of GM is subtracted from the aCompCor masks.
This mask is obtained by dilating a GM mask extracted from the FreeSurfer's *aseg* segmentation, and it ensures components are not extracted
from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM.
Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by
thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation).
Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.
For each CompCor decomposition, the *k* components with the largest singular
values are retained, such that the retained components' time series are
sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF,
WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from
consideration.
The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also
placed within the corresponding confounds file.
The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global
signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and
quadratic terms for each [@confounds_satterthwaite_2013].
Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or
1.5 standardized DVARS were annotated as motion outliers.
Additional nuisance timeseries are calculated by means of principal components
analysis of the signal found within a thin band (*crown*) of voxels around
the edge of the brain, as proposed by [@patriat_improved_2017].
All resamplings can be performed with *a single interpolation
step* by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion
transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available,
and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces).
Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using `nitransforms`,
configured with cubic B-spline interpolation.


Many internal operations of *fMRIPrep* use
*Nilearn* 0.10.4 [@nilearn, RRID:SCR_001362],
mostly within the functional processing workflow.

    abstract = {Head motion is a significant source of noise in the estimation of functional connectivity from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Current strategies to reduce this noise include image realignment, censoring time points corrupted by motion, and including motion realignment parameters and their derivatives as additional nuisance regressors in the general linear model. However, this nuisance regression approach assumes that the motion-induced signal changes are linearly related to the estimated realignment parameters, which is not always the case. In this study we develop an improved model of motion-related signal changes, where nuisance regressors are formed by first rotating and translating a single brain volume according to the estimated motion, re-registering the data, and then performing a principal components analysis (PCA) on the resultant time series of both moved and re-registered data. We show that these “Motion Simulated (MotSim)” regressors account for significantly greater fraction of variance, result in higher temporal signal-to-noise, and lead to functional connectivity estimates that are less affected by motion compared to the most common current approach of using the realignment parameters and their derivatives as nuisance regressors. This improvement should lead to more accurate estimates of functional connectivity, particularly in populations where motion is prevalent, such as patients and young children.},
